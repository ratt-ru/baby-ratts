\section*{Colophon}
I have a very pedantic and exotic taste for things. There's never a gray area regarding this, I either like something or not. Unfortunately for me, my financial circumstances as per now do not afford me the luxury of choice (LOL!). Rather, I'm forced to create my own realities (read recreate my exotic tastes) with what I have, and all the freebies I can get (within good reason of course). More often than not, my recreations and adaptations must be outstanding to me before being presented publicly because they are, in essence, a representation of my palate. The aesthetic of this thesis encompasses this here opinion.

This thesis was an attempt at recreating the most aesthetically pleasing thesis I've ever seen from Aaron Turon\footnote{\url{https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/turon/thesis.pdf}}. However, since I could not find the original template, I was lucky enough to stumble upon the wonderful work developed by Andr\'e Miede and Ivo PletikosiÄ‡ who typeset this document using the typographical look-and-feel \texttt{classicthesis}. The style was inspired by Robert Bringhurst's seminal book on typography ``\emph{The Elements of Typographic Style}''. I customised the template to my liking, and changed the main fonts to a mixture of BaskerValdADFstd (a freebie because the original font, Baskerville, is super expensive!) and LinuxBiolinum.

\texttt{classicthesis} is available for both \LaTeX\ and \mLyX:

Happy users of \texttt{classicthesis} usually send a real postcard to the author, who features the received postcards at:

A big thanks to them for making work easier :D!
